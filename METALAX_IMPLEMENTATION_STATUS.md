### Usage Instructions

#### Quick Start
```bash
git checkout metalax-staging
npm install
npm run backend     # Start image processing server
npm run test:solana # Validate all functionality
npm start          # Launch Electron app (desktop only)
```

#### Development Workflow
1. Make changes to codebase
2. Test with `npm run test:solana`
3. Validate backend with `npm run backend`
4. Commit to metalax-staging branch

### Next Steps Recommendations

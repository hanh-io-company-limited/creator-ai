## Key Changes Made

### 1. Open-Source AI Engine Implementation
- **Replaced**: Mock AI engine with real TensorFlow.js and Transformers.js integration
- **Added**: Support for GPT-2, DistilGPT-2, GPT-Neo, and Stable Diffusion models
- **Features**: Real model loading, training, and inference capabilities

### 2. Model Management System
- **New Feature**: Model Library with open-source model browser
- **Download System**: Local download and caching of models from Hugging Face
- **UI Enhancement**: Interactive model cards with download/load buttons
- **Storage**: All models stored locally in `/models` directory

### 3. Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "@tensorflow/tfjs": "^4.15.0",
  "@xenova/transformers": "^2.9.0",
  "jimp": "^0.22.10"
}
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Features
- Non-root container execution
- Environment variable management
- SSL/TLS support ready
- Security headers configuration
- Rate limiting implementation
- Firewall configuration guidance

### Recommended Security Practices
1. **Use strong secrets** for JWT and session keys
2. **Enable SSL/TLS** for production deployments
3. **Configure firewall** to limit access
4. **Regular updates** of system and dependencies
5. **Monitor logs** for security events

## üìà Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
- **Health endpoint**: `GET /health` - Application status
- **Status endpoint**: `GET /api/status` - Detailed system info
- **Container monitoring**: Docker stats and logs
- **Resource monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk usage

### Maintenance Tasks
- **Log rotation** to prevent disk space issues
- **Regular backups** of application data
- **Security updates** for base images and dependencies
- **Performance monitoring** and optimization

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Container startup failures** - Check logs and environment variables
2. **Health check failures** - Verify network connectivity and application status
3. **Performance issues** - Monitor resource usage and adjust limits
4. **SSL/TLS issues** - Verify certificate configuration

### Support Resources
- Comprehensive logs in application and nginx containers
- Health check endpoints for debugging
- Integration test suite for validation
- Detailed error messages and status codes

## üìû Next Steps
